Daniel Wiener
=============

Using the starter theme -  _s, or underscores - I am reworking, updating the theme for my website - danielwiener.com - so that it will be easier to work on, change design, etc. I am also going to integrate the art portfolio section made with CakePHP and this Wordpress section.
